    "## Modifying the PAM\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we *could* modify the PAM (as should be the case if we're inserting the tag at the C-terminus). We now need to track where the modifications to the PAM actually are. When doing this, there is an assumption we're going to use that will make our lives easier. The assumption is this: our PAM, and any codons that it is part of, will not overlap an intronic region. It may overlap one of the UTRs, but it will not overlap an intron.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is likely a fair assumption, because our PAM should be relatively close to the beginning or end of the coding sequence; so this assumption will hold unless the first or last exon is incredibly short. It should be noted that this assumption _can_ be violated. Genes do exist with quite small exons, and in the future, you would need to modify your code to handle that. But the gene we're giving you for this assignment does not violate this assumption, and so we're going to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, there are four possibilities regarding the two relevant bases of the PAM:\n",
    "1. They are both contained within a single codon\n",
    "2. They are split between two separate codons (as in the example above)\n",
    "3. One exists within a codon, and the other is within a UTR\n",
    "4. Both are within a UTR\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, determine the start and end positions of the region in the target gene that is modified when we modify the PAM. **We'll assume we can modify the PAM as much as possible**. The end position should be 1 greater than the position of the last modified base (we're going to want to use it to index the target sequence later). Store both of these values in variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">**NOTE:**</font> This code should only run _if_ the PAM is able to be modified, as determined above.\n",

    "And that's it! You're done! You've written a program in Python that takes some target gene and tag of interest, and creates the crRNA and repair template necessary to add that tag to the target gene. As long as your target gene is in WormBase format (such that coding sequence is uppercase and non-coding sequence is lower case), this program should be able to create CRISPR reagents for any gene and tag. I don't know about you, but I think that's pretty cool.\n",

Why did we make this assumption? Imagine a codon that is split by an intron. If we need to modify this codon when modifying either the PAM or the crRNA-binding region, it's possible the modified region could stretch across the intron, making our repair template huge. This assumption is, of course, not always going to be true. It's possible that one of the first or last exons could be sufficiently small that either of these regions could overlap an intron. Think about how you could modify your code to deal with a situation like this.\n",

Think about how you could modify your program to incorporate knowledge about regulatory regions like this.\n",

You can change the sequence of the target gene, the sequence of the tag, or the insert terminus (either N or C). Instead of running each code cell one at time, you can run your whole notebook sequentially by pressing `Ctrl + F9` (or selecting \"Run All\" under the Runtime tab at the top of the page).\n",

If you did have fun, we certainly encourage you to continue building these skills further. If you've gotten the coding bug, there are a lot of ways to keep it up. JHU has a number of courses that either teach you programming or have you learn it in application to another subject. If you want to talk about other ways to learn coding, or to expand or modify this code here, please get in touch - we'd be so happy to hear from you (Dylan Taylor - dtaylo95@jhu.edu; Sara Carioscia - saracarioscia@jhu.edu).\n"
