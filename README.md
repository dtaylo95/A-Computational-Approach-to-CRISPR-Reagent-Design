# A Computational Approach to CRISPR Reagent Design

This repository contains code and resources for "A Computational Approach to CRISPR Reagent Design" module of the Developmental Genetics undergraduate lab course at Johns Hopkins University. It has been updated here to serve as a standalone resources for anyone interested in creating CRISPR reagents via Python.

These notebooks were developed jointly by [Dylan Taylor](https://github.com/dtaylo95) and [Sara Carioscia](https://github.com/scarioscia) as part of their Instructional Enhancement Grant from the [Johns Hopkins Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation](https://ctei.jhu.edu/programs-and-services/instructional-enhancement-grant-program).

This module is designed to 
1) introduce biology students with little prior coding experience to the basics of computer programming  
2) apply fundamental Python to reinforce the process of generating reagents for *any* CRISPR-Cas9 experiments

The module comprises several iPython notebooks. Each notebook acts as a skeleton that students can then use to write their own code. These notebooks are made available  to students through [Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MUERIV1NhmkFKbnEgbE7ZV5-zk78uVJc?usp=sharing), allowing them to work together and enabling instructors to provide feedback directly in the notebook.

## Module Schedule 

Weeks 1 and 2: Students learn the basics of Python programming and Jupyter Notebooks (accessed via Google Colab). These notebooks are in the [intro_notebooks](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/tree/main/intro_notebooks) directory. Students then complete two homework assignments ([01_Python_intro_hw1.ipynb](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/blob/main/homeworks/01_Python_intro_hw1.ipynb) and [02_Python_intro_hw2.ipynb](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/blob/main/homeworks/02_Python_intro_hw2.ipynb) in the [homeworks](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/tree/main/homeworks) directory) to reinforce these Python skills, which are integral for the CRISPR reagent design.

Week 3: Students apply these skills to identify (for a given modification of a given gene) 1) the PAM sequence closest to the site of modification and 2) the crRNA sequence corresponding to this PAM ([03_CRISPRDesign_HW1.ipynb](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/blob/main/homeworks/03_CRISPRDesign_HW1.ipynb) in the [homeworks](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/tree/main/homeworks) directory).

Weeks 4 and 5: Students develop the repair template corresponding to this same modification ([04_CRISPRDesign_HW2.ipynb](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/blob/main/homeworks/04_CRISPRDesign_HW2.ipynb) in the [homeworks](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design/tree/main/homeworks) directory).

Feel free to use this if you have a group of students who might benefit - or if you're a curious biologist yourself! Reach out directly to Dylan (dtaylo95@jhu.edu) or Sara (saracarioscia@jhu.edu) if you have any questions or suggestions. If there's a feature or other update you'd like added, please submit an issue directly on GitHub.
