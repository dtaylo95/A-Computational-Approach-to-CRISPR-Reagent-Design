We do that by assigning pieces of data to variables. **A variable is essentially a name that you give to some piece of data in Python.** The name can be whatever you want, with some restrictions. It can't have any spaces, can't start with a number, and shouldn't be the same as one of Python's inherent variables or functions (don't worry about this just yet). Notably, **variables are case-sensitive**. Usually, you want to name the variable in a way that makes sense for the data assigned to that variable. For example, I could create a variable called `my_age`, to store my age.\n","\n","The data that you store in a variable can be an integer (e.g. `3`), a float (e.g. `3.1` - a number with a decimal), a string of characters (`'Hello world'`, called a \"string\"), or any other data type python can handle. We'll talk about some other examples of datatypes later.\n","\n","We can assign our variables using the `=` operator. So I can set the value of `my_age` to be the integer `20` by doing the following:\n","\n","`my_age = 20`\n","\n","The spaces next to the `=` aren't actually necessary, and in general, Python doesn't care too much about spaces (assuming those spaces are not part of a string or at the beginning of a line). There are some exceptions, but don't worry about that right now.\n","\n","Once we assign a variable, we can access the associated value by just typing the variable name instead. For all intents and purposes, the variable *IS* that value."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xuKUPk0tCNRm"},"source":["### Integers, Strings, and Floats\n","\n","Integers, strings, and floats are the three most basic data types that Python can work with and they serve as the building blocks of other, more complex data types. We discussed them above, but we'll reiterate what each of the three are here.\n","\n","**Integers**: Integers are counting (i.e. whole) numbers. They can be positive or negative. Notably, *they do not have a decimal point*. So in Python `3` is an integer, but `3.0` is not. \n","\n","**Floats**: Like integers, floats (or floating point numbers) are numbers. The distinction is that floats contain decimal points; they don't have to be whole numbers. Floats are just your every day rational numbers and are used as such. `3.0`, `3.1`, and `4.675` are all examples of floats. \n","\n","**Strings**: Strings are just sequences of characters. This can include spaces, tabs, line breaks and numbers; we're not limited to letters. Strings are case-sensitive. You define a string using quotations marks, either single `'this is a string'` or double `\"this is also a string\"`. Numbers that are enclosed in quotation marks are part of a string, so this `\"4.0\"` is a string, whereas this `4.0` is a float.\n","\n","Let's create some variables that store our name, age, and our favorite approximation of pi. \n","\n","**Name**: Our name should be a string. Strings should be enclosed in quotes. Either double quotes `\"like this\"` or single quotes, `'like this'`.\n","\n","**Age**: Our age should be an integer, so we just write the number without a decimal point.\n","\n","**Pi**: Our approximation of pi should be a float, and should include a decimal point.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tU75d6ZeuV7h"},"source":["my_age = 20\n","my_name = \"Johnathan\"\n","my_pi = 3.14"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sYr1u5TOuV7i"},"source":["To check the value of any of our variables, we can use the `print` function.
